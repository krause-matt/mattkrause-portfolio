# Matt Krause Project Portfolio

This is my personal project portfolio to showcase apps I have created while learning web development over the past year. I'm using React to dynamically display different skills and projects through state management. Styling is done with Sass and the site is fully responsive.

## Project List

*Ballpark Rater : App for locating and reviewing professional baseball stadiums
*FITtrain : Landing page for a modern gym
*Garden Plotter : Social site for documenting and sharing your personal garden
*Pizza Place : eCommerce site to order pizza online
\*Senate Vote Comparator : Compare votes between US senators dating back to 1989 using the ProPublica congress API
