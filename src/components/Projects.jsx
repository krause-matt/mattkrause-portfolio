Being my first larger-scale app, learning several new concepts at once challenged me. I was introduced to RESTful routing, CRUD operations, middleware, and databases. The practice I got with asynchronous JavaScript was beneficial and a necessary tool I took on most of my following projects. Have fun checking out the site and leave a rating for any ballparks you've visited!",

Several customizable garden features and components were purposely included to learn Redux state management. My main focus for this project was the front-end, so I took care of the REST API with a limited npm package. Implementing CRUD operations using this strategy was tricky. If I were to build the app today, I'd establish a proper database and allow photo uploads. I learned authentication/authorization using Google OAuth for this app.",

The order customization portion of the app was a great learning process, as I had a combination of drop-downs, radio buttons, and checkboxes all contributing to state. I learned Google Firebase and Stripe to take care of the backend database and payment processes. I would like to try implementing Redux into this app or my next e-commerce project for more efficient state management between major components.",

With almost 20 state items and multiple API requests, I had to work through problems with infinite React rendering. I used log statements to better understand the process order of my code and help correctly set my useEffect dependencies and useRef variables.",

I had seen both CSS grid and Sass being used while watching developer tutorials on YouTube, and wanted to try them for myself. The speed at which you can design an app with Bootstrap is convenient, but I enjoyed getting to utilize my creative chops a bit more with custom styling. I have taken my lesson on Sass forward to other work, including the portfolio site you're on right now!",
